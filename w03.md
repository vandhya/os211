# W03's TOP 10 Pages

1. [DOS to UNIX file format](https://sodocumentation.net/vim/topic/3827/converting-text-files-from-dos-to-unix-with-vi#using-vim-s-fileformat)<br>
I was having trouble updating my .bash_aliases file because I was copying and pasting the code into a windows editor, 
which caused some issues because it won't run due to the file being a dos fileformat rather than a unix fileformat. Thankfully though, it was an easy fix. Thanks
to this page anyways.

2. [How do you compress and extract using tar?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tar-command-linux-examples/)<br>
This site briefly explains tar commands. Now i know that `tar cfj myW08.tar.bz2 W08/` means that we are creating a bzip2 archive called `myW08.tar.bz2` in the `W08/` directory. Also, this site doesn't explain what the `t` in `tar tfj myW08.tar.bz2` means, I'll explain here, it stands for table of contents: it shows me what's in the `myW08.tar.bz2` archive.

3. [Markdown again?](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax#code-blocks)<br>
This page should've been here since w01, but I didn't bother learning basic markdown syntax until now.
> **now** *look* ***what*** `I can do.`

4. [NFS vs CIFS](https://www.educba.com/cifs-vs-nfs/)<br>
On the topic of Remote File Systems, the initials 'NFS' is not related to any racing video game franchise. The site explains the difference between a Network File System (standard UNIX client-server file sharing protocol) versus Common Internet File System (standard Windows protocol).  

5. [Copying from windows to linux virtual machine](https://stackabuse.com/using-scp-to-copy-and-securely-transfer-files-and-folders/)<br>
So far, I've found that this is one of the only ways to copy a file from windows to my vbox. I've looked far into the depths of google to find out how I could just `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` lines of code into my vbox without success. So for example, I want to copy `myscript.sh` from my desktop to my virtual machine, I simply write `scp -P 6022 "C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\myscript.sh" vandhya@localhost:/home/vandhya/` to my cmd in windows. In this example, `scp` (Secure Copy Protocol) looks in the directory `"C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\myscript.sh"` and the `-P 6022` means that I am overriding to port 6022 where my virtual machine is, and `vandhya@localhost:/home/vandhya/` is where the file will be kept in my virtual machine. 

6. [What is a file system?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/htg-explains-what-is-a-file-system-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them/)<br>
An overview of what a file system does, the types of file systems, and the differences between each file system. Useful page to get started on understanding what a file system is.

7. [Video demonstration of a file system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzUyMy7Ihk0)<br>
This is a short video explaining the concept of how a file system works, visually. This video conveyed the concept of a file system in such a way that is understandable even for Dummy McDumbDumb (like me).

8. [What are these weird directories, and why are they there?](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/filesystem-hierarchy-standard)<br>
This article explains briefly about the Linux directory structure, more specifically about Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). FHS was created to standardize how directories should be organized and which files should be stored where, so that distributions could have a single reference point from which to work.

9. [Linux - Tarballs, Archive and Compress Folders (tar)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0yqs8t6ywo)<br>
Eli the computer guy explains to me intuitively in windows terms, what a tarball is. Basically the tar part is the archive you are esentially "zipping" and the ball part is the compressing part of the process. He then goes to show how you could actually archive, compress, and uncompress a file folder in linux.
