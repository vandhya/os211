# W01's TOP 10 Pages

1. [VIM Adventures] (https://vim-adventures.com/)<br>
VIM Adventures is a website where you can learn VIM commands in a form of a game. It's pretty useful for people like me who 
doesn't like to read walls and walls of text.

2. [regular-expressions.info] (https://www.regular-expressions.info/)<br>
This site is nice cause it's easy to navigate, explains how everything works intuitively, and it keeps each page short
enough to not be just a huge wall of text.
