# W08's TOP 10 Pages

1. [Multiple processor scheduling](http://operatingsystempoly.blogspot.com/p/multiple-processor-scheduling.html)<br>
This page briefly explains about Load Balancing. An important goal in a multiprocessor system is to balance the load between processors, so that one processor won't be sitting idle while another is overloaded. Systems using a common ready queue are naturally self-balancing, and do not need any special handling. Most systems, however, maintain separate ready queues for each processor. 

2. [Operating System Scheduling algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
A tutorialspoint article on scheduling. Explains six popular process scheduling algorithms which we discuss in this chapter of Operating Systems. These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive.

3. [CPU-I/O Burst Cycle](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/6_CPU_Scheduling.html)<br>
Process execution begins with a CPU burst. That is followed by an I/O burst, which is followed by another CPU burst, then another I/O burst, and so on. Eventually, the inal CPU burst ends with a system request to terminate execution.

4. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
A studytonight dot com article on CPU Scheduling. Explains the dispatcher, types of CPU Scheduling, and also critera for CPU Scheduling. Explains with readable font and is quite useful on quiz.

5. [Short-term vs Medium-term vs Long-term scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/short-term-vs-medium-term-vs-long-term-scheduling)<br>
Another tutorialspoint dot com article. This time about Process scheduling which involves short-term scheduling, medium-term scheduling and long-term scheduling. The page explains it using a diagram and an explanation of said diagram.

6. [What is the Round Robin scheduling algorithm? ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/)<br>
This link will take you to the Geeksforgeeks website. This website is very interesting because the UI has a light theme, the explanations are also accompanied by pictures, and there is a table for comparison. In conclusion, the Round Robin algorithm is an algorithm which allows processes to be executed with a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. 

7. [Multilevel Queue Scheduling](http://ftp.gunadarma.ac.id/linux/docs/v06/Kuliah/SistemOperasi/BUKU/SistemOperasi-4.X-1/ch14s06.html)<br>
This link will direct you to the website of our neighboring university, namely UGM (Gunadarma Margonda University). This website is pretty cool because it has pictures and diagrams which help to explain. In conclusion, Multilevel Queue Scheduling is an algorithm based on a process priority system. So, if each process can be grouped by priority, you will find a queue like the image on this website (see for yourself for easier understanding). 

8. [Shortest Job First?](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/shortest-job-first)<br>
A studytonight dot com article. This website is great because the explanation is comprehensiible and also accompanied by images. In conclusion, the shortest job first scheduling algorithm is an algorithm that runs processes based on the shortest burst time or duration. 

9. [FCFS scheduling algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)<br>
This link will take you to the guru99 website. The site explains in a very understandable language and is easy to digest because of the employment of diagrams and images. In conclusion, the first-come first-serve scheduling algorithm is an algorithm that automatically executes requests and processes queues based on the order in which they arrive. 

10. [What is an OVA?](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/MSBTech/Installing+OVA+files+using+VirtualBox)<br>
This is a quick look on what an OVA file is. OVA File in short is like a backup or express installation for a Virtual Machine (VM). Let's just say that it is pretty similar like how you install an app in android devices using apk file.
