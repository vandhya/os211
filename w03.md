1. [DOS to UNIX file format](https://sodocumentation.net/vim/topic/3827/converting-text-files-from-dos-to-unix-with-vi#using-vim-s-fileformat)<br>
I was having trouble updating my .bash_aliases file because I was copying and pasting the code into a windows editor, 
which caused some issues because it won't run due to the file being a dos fileformat rather than a unix fileformat. Thankfully though, it was an easy fix. Thanks
to this page anyways.
