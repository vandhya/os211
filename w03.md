# W03's TOP 10 Pages

1. [DOS to UNIX file format](https://sodocumentation.net/vim/topic/3827/converting-text-files-from-dos-to-unix-with-vi#using-vim-s-fileformat)<br>
I was having trouble updating my .bash_aliases file because I was copying and pasting the code into a windows editor, 
which caused some issues because it won't run due to the file being a dos fileformat rather than a unix fileformat. Thankfully though, it was an easy fix. Thanks
to this page anyways.

2. [How do you compress and extract using tar?](https://www.howtogeek.com/248780/how-to-compress-and-extract-files-using-the-tar-command-on-linux/)<br>
This site briefly explains tar commands. Now i know that `tar cfj myW08.tar.bz2 W08/` means that we are creating a bzip2 archive called `myW08.tar.bz2` in the `W08/` directory. Also, this site doesn't explain what the `t` in `tar tfj myW08.tar.bz2` means, I'll explain here, it stands for table of contents: it shows me what's in an archive.

3. [Markdown again?](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax#code-blocks)<br>
This page should've been here since w01, but I didn't bother learning basic markdown syntax until now.
> **now** *look* ***what*** `I can do.`
