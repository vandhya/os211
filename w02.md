# W02's Top 10 Pages

1. [The Difference Between SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-256 Hash Algorithms](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256-hash-algorithms/)<br>
I started out knowing nothing about what SHA256 even is, but after a quick read of this blog article, I was able to 
understand what it is, how hashing algorithms work, what they're used for, and I also learned a little bit about 
digital signatures and how it relates to security and protection of data.

2. [Privacy vs Security?](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-privacy-vs-security-whats-the-difference.html#:~:text=Privacy%20relates%20to%20any%20rights,your%20personal%20information%20is%20protected.)<br>
In terms of web security and privacy, we need to know how both relates to each other. Simple and useful tips on how to keep yourself safe on the internet, are often those that could save you a fortune, like in the example on the page, your sensitive and valuable data can be sold and misused with criminal intent, that is, if you don't keep your privacy and security in check. 

3. [Data Breaches?](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/data-breach)<br>
Still in the topic of sensitive and valuable data, here's a quick look on what a data breach is, methods of data breaching, the phases of a data breach, and the best practices for keeping your data safe. It also reports on how much big companies have suffered from a data breach, showing that you can't always trust your data in big companies, you have to also take care of your own sake.

4. [C](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-variables-constants)<br>
Out of all the c-language tutorial sites, I have found that this site by programiz.com provides the best looking, least painful layout to look at. Though it doesn't have a live on-site program compiler, it explains how everything works through examples, which, isn't such a bad way to explain c anyways. To be honest those on-site program compilers are mostly a gimmick, IMO anyways. Don't need 'em.  

5. [Cyber Security course on some other uni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqmQg-cszw4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP62K2DjQLRxDNRi0z2IRWnNh)<br>
I've found this playlist on the topic of Cyber Security. It's from the MIT. Dunno where or what that is, but apparently they have opencoursewares on multiple other courses as well. Pretty nice. The lecturer seems excited.

6. [UNIX GPG Commands](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/gpg.htm)<br>
I know i have expressed my distate for long walls of text but in this case, I could just ctrl+f which command I needed. Plus, there's also a quick example ono how to encrypt, decrypt, and generate key pairs albeit in the very bottom of the page. Still very useful for when I eventually need to look it up.

7. [Harvard's CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Eds2Rc_x8)<br>
I have found another video course from some other university called 'Harvard'. The lecturer is lecturing the class on the C-language. I've actually watched other CS50 lecture videos before; the lecturer, David J. Malan, is an awesome person, he teaches computer science in a way that keeps the students excited and interested in whatever topic he is lecturing. I suggest whoever has not tried CS50 to try and follow along. It's pretty fun. 

8. [Security for Operating Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_security.htm)<br>
Briefly explains security measures for operating systems through authentication, one time passwords, and also briefly explains threats for programs and systems along with computer security classifications.

9. [What is an ACL?](https://www.ittsystems.com/access-control-list-acl/)<br>
This is one of the topics briefly mentioned in the lecture slides, so I went ahead and looked it up. ACLs (Access Control List) are network traffic filters that can control incoming or outgoing traffic. The main idea of using an ACL is to provide security to your network. Without it, any traffic is either allowed to enter or exit, making it more vulnerable to unwanted and dangerous traffic. There you go.

10. [Trojan Horses?](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/trojans)<br>
As a former pirate of the interwebs, I often mistakenly install viruses into my computer rather than whatever it is I was pirating. Back in the day, when I would open my antivirus software and scan my system, there'd be multiple infected files with a Trojan Horse virus on it. I never knew or rather, I never cared enough to google what a Trojan Horse virus is, but now I know better. Cool.
