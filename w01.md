EdX is a pretty useful site which a lot of the world's top universities work together to provide an enviroment where anyone can learn
high quality, high level university courses at no cost. This sounds like an advertisement, but EdX is just a good place to learn in general.
There are plenty of courses from multiple different sources to learn Linux from. You could also get certificates for finishing a course (at an expense).
