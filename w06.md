# W06's TOP 10 Pages

1. [Multithreading Code - Computerphile](https://youtu.be/7ENFeb-J75k)<br>
A computerphile video explaining how to use multithreading to my/your advantage in coding. 

2. [Concurrency, Threading and Parallelism Explained - video](https://youtu.be/olYdb0DdGtM)<br>
Explains the basics of threading, concurrency, and parallelism. Tech with Tim provides
good explanation through a digital whiteboard.

3. [Linux Processes](http://www.science.unitn.it/~fiorella/guidelinux/tlk/node45.html)<br>
Covers linux processes by functional areas: state, scheduling information, identifiers, 
inter-process communication, links, times and timers, file system, virtual memory, and processor
specific context.

4. [Zombie and Orphan Processes in Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/zombie-and-orphan-processes-in-linux)<br>
As stated in the site, it explains the details of the zombie, orphan and daemon processes. 
It makes sense why they're called the way they are now.

5. [Threading Issues](https://binaryterms.com/threading-issues-in-os.html)<br>
The site explains threading issues when we are in a multithreading environment. Plain and simple.

6. [What is Process Synchronization in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-process-synchronization-in-operating-system)<br>
Explains how synchronization was introduced to handle problems that arose while multiple process executions.

7. [PThreads Vs Win32 Threads](https://www.slideshare.net/abufayez/pthreads-vs-win32-threads)<br>
Comparison between threading mechanism in Win32 and POSIX systems

8. [Thread Pools in Java](https://youtu.be/ZcKt5FYd3bU)<br>
As the title suggests, this video by Jakob Jenkov explains what a Thread Pool is, an 
alternative to creating a new thread per task to execute. 
Instead, a number of pre-created threads exist in a pool - 
into which you can submit tasks to be executed by these pooled threads. 

9. [Implicit Threading with OpenMP](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/OpenCSF/Books/csf/html/ImplicitThreads.html#:~:text=Implicit%20threading%20is%20the%20use,library%20code%20at%20compile%20time.)<br>
A .edu page explaining Implicit Threading, the use of libraries or other language support to hide the management of threads.
In the context of C, the most common implicit threading library is OpenMP

10. [Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/grand-central-dispatch-gcd)<br>
A tutorialspoint.com article on Apple's MacOS and iOS operating systems technology for
a combination of extensions to the C language, an API, and a run-time library that allows application developers to 
identify sections of code to run in parallel. Like OpenMP, GCD manages most of the details of threading.
