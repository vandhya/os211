# W01's TOP 10 Pages

1. [VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)<br>
VIM Adventures is a website where you can learn VIM commands in a form of a game. It's pretty useful for people like me who 
doesn't like to read walls and walls of text.

2. [regular-expressions.info](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)<br>
This site is nice cause it's easy to navigate, explains how everything works intuitively, and it keeps each page short
enough to not be just a huge wall of text.

3. [What is SSH?](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/what-ssh-and-how-do-i-use-it)<br>
Did i tell you how much i hate walls of text? This article explains to me briefly on what SSH is used for and why people use
it's service in application.

4. [Learnshell.org](https://www.learnshell.org/)<br>
Learnshell.org is another tutorial website to learn bash where i could read minimal text and do more excersise in practice. I
like the interactivity of the site.

5. [Why learn bash?](https://command-line.net/why-learn-bash.html)<br>
I was curious on why we still need to learn how to use bash, and this site explained to me that bash is the default enviroment for a lot
of things i use, like python and java. Things like git is a bash-oriented tool. So it is pretty useful to know how to use. 

6. [Git Commands Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)<br>
No more GSGS for git commands! Now i could look at the most used git commands in this page instead.
