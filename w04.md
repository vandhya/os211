# W04's TOP 10 Pages

1. [Dynamic Memory Allocation and Fragmentation in C and C++](https://www.design-reuse.com/articles/25090/dynamic-memory-allocation-fragmentation-c.html)<br>
This week's subject is about memory addressing and memory allocation. In C, dynamic memory is allocated from the heap using some standard library functions.
The two key dynamic memory functions are malloc() and free().


2. [Little and Big Endian Mystery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)<br>
The site explains two ways of storing multibyte data-types ( int, float, etc). In little endian machines, last byte of binary representation of the 
multibyte data-type is stored first. On the other hand, in big endian machines, first byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first.

3. [Data is everything, and everything is data](https://blog.pythian.com/data-everything-everything-data/)<br>
On the subject of memory, we also talk about data and it's miniworld. The site explains "datafication”, a process that turns all aspects of life—preferences, 
opinions, telephone calls and sensor-driven information—into data

4. [The Paging Game](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/ThePagingGame.html)<br>
University of Illinois Chicago's Operating Systems course notes. It's a game about memory paging in Operating Systems. Haven't tried but looks cool.

5. [Cache Memory in Computer Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-memory-in-computer-organization/)<br>
Another geeksforgeeks site. A good page to remind you how cache memory works in computers. Cache Memory is a special very high-speed memory.
It is used to speed up and synchronizing with high-speed CPU. Used to reduce the average time to access data from the Main memory. 


6. [Static and Dynamic Linking in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operating-systems/)<br>
More geeksforgeeks site. Explains advantages and disadvantages of static vs dynamic linking in operating systems. Quick and simple.

7. [Paging & Memory Management](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/su09/cse120/lectures/Lecture7.pdf)<br>
Another course notes from another university. Paging solves the external fragmentation problem by using fixed sizedunits in both physical and virtual memory.

8. [chkdsk – Guide for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10](https://neosmart.net/wiki/chkdsk/#CHKDSK_in_Windows_10)<br>
Well my data drive said it has been corrupted whilst i was working on tutorials. All of my college data this semester is in that drive. To say I
panicked is an understatement, but thankfully, i could recover most of the data using chkdsk command.

9. [Difference between Internal Fragmentation and External Fragmentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-internal-fragmentation-and-external-fragmentation)<br>
Explains fragmentation, and key differences between internal fragmentation vs external fragmentation. A quick read.

10. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
Ok. Last geeksforgeeks page. Clearly explains the difference between logical and physical address in operating systems. It's typical geeksforgeeks fashion 
of explaining things. The end.
