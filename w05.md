# W05's TOP 10 Pages

1. [How Virtual Memory Works](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/virtual-memory.htm)<br>
This week's topic is about virtual memory. This article explains briefly about how computers make use of hard disks to create
more space in random access memory. Also shows you how to set up a virtual memory.

2. [Difference between Demand Paging and Segmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-demand-paging-and-segmentation/)<br>
Another g4g article explaining operating systems course materials. This one explains the two approaches to memory management: Demand Paging vs
Segmentation. Quick, easy, simple, done.

3. [Page Fault by Udacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqQOIahM868)<br>
This udacity course about page fault explains what happens when an application requests a virtual address that's not mapped to physical memory,
but is somewhere on the disk. Long story short, page fault handler comes in to check if requests are valid, and so on.

4. [Penanganan Page Fault](http://ftp.gunadarma.ac.id/linux/docs/v06/Kuliah/SistemOperasi/BUKU/SistemOperasi-4.X-2/ch05s03.html)<br>
Lecture notes from the university next door. A quick and simple procedure on how to handle a page fault. There are also more notes
about the topic if you keep turning the page over.

5. [First-In First-Out (FIFO) Page Replacement Algorithm in OS with Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET43MRKRuYM)<br>
When in doubt, a quick search on a subject matter in YouTube is just what you need. Resource on operating systems material
on YouTube are scarce, but you'll always find what you need. This time, it's about the FIFO algorithm by Simple Snippets.

6. [Least Recently Used (LRU) Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wVp97-uqr0)<br>
Another YouTube video explaining operating systems material, this time about Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm.
Explains about page fault, page hit, and disadvantages of LRU.

7. [Second Chance Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C26qsPwf-Js)<br>
Next is the Second Chance replacement algorithm, this time a higher quality video which explains about the algorithm and how it works.
The video is made by Dr. Robert Dimpsey, who explains things better than most online tutors on YouTube.

8. [Top Command in Linux](https://linuxhint.com/top_-command-_linux/)<br>
This week's assignment. The page explains about the top command reports valuable system information like running processes and resource usage. 
It shows processor activity and kernel-managed tasks in real-time. It’s one of the staple tools for system administrators.

9. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
Feels like a sin putting another g4g page here, but here it is. Explains the two algorithms commonly used to allocate frames to a process.
Also explains how yhe number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether you have used global 
replacement or local replacement for replacing pages in case of a page fault.

10. [Physical and Virtual Memory in Windows 10](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/physical-and-virtual-memory-in-windows-10/e36fb5bc-9ac8-49af-951c-e7d39b979938)<br>
This page explains how physical and virtual memory works on our beloved operating system, windows. /j. We can look at how Windows Memory Representation
work by looking at our task manager. You can see how much memory you are using, how many is available,
how many are cached, and so on. It goes pretty in-depth into explaining how everything works.
